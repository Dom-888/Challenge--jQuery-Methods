# Contains four Codeinstitute challenges designed to explore jQuery methods

<br>

## First Challenge

- When a stream is clicked in the nav, that stream’s cards will transition and change background-color. When another stream is clicked, only that stream will transition and change background-color.

<br>

## Second Challenge

- Add some links to the card paragraphs that don’t need to go anywhere (href=”#”).
- Add a script that performs the following:
- When a paragraph is clicked, all the links within it are highlighted in yellow.

<br>

## Third Challenge

- Give the paragraphs inside the cards a display: none;
- Use slideDown to display the card paragraphs when the card_image is clicked.

<br>

## Forth Challenge

- When a card is clicked on, the background color is highlighted – e.g., set background-color to pink via adding a new class.
- When the card is clicked again, it is unhighlighted

<br>

## Fifth Challenge

- Add two more nav elements to the nav bar, select and all. When select is clicked, all panels disappear except those highlighted by clicking on them. It is a difficult challenge. Think about what is different about the highlighted panels. How could we select only those without the highlighting?
- Then make all the panels reappear by clicking all.
